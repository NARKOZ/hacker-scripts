.SYNOPSIS
    Simple script to connect to a coffee part using TelNet then issue specific commands that
	brew and pourt a cup of coffee for the user.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script was converted using the ruby version of the fucking_coffee script. In this script,
    I left the use of environment variables since its only use was to determine if the user was
    still logged in to the system.  Per issue #42 (https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/issues/42)
    I left the password string hard coded until a decision is made by NARKOZ, the project owner, as
    to how the information should be stored.
.OUTPUT
    None
